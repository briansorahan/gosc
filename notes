newUgen(name string, rate int8, args ...interface{}) (*UgenGraph, error)

UgenGraph:
- exposes list of contstants
- exposes number of ugens
- total number of outputs in graph is one less than number of ugens

1. Initialize a new ugen with an empty list of inputs and an empty list of outputs. This will become the root of the new graph.
2. Loop over the args.
  2.1. If arg is a constant
