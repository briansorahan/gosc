## Translating synthdefs from sclang to golang

One of the first things you must learn in order to be able to use SuperCollider
is how to write synthdefs. After reading this guide you should be pretty
comfortable with creating synthdefs.

This guide assumes that you are comfortable with reading and writing
synthdefs in sclang. If you aren't I suggest reading [this](http://doc.sccode.org/Tutorials/Getting-Started/10-SynthDefs-and-Synths.html)
and play around with creating synthdefs with sclang a bit
before deciding to write them in go.

### Ugen Inputs

In sc all ugen inputs are implementations of the [Input](types/input.go)
interface. This has some very important ramifications on how
you write synthdefs.

First of all, unlike sclang, you can not use numeric literals as inputs to ugens.

Every constant input to a ugen must be wrapped with the [C](ugens/c.go) type.

This means that most synthdefs written in go will be a bit more
verbose than their sclang counterparts. But I believe this is the
best way to have polymorphic ugen inputs.

### Synthdef Parameters

Since go is a statically typed language, the UgenFunc type

```go
type UgenFunc func(p *Params) Ugen
```

provides a way to add parameters to synthdefs by doing

```go
bus := C(0)
freq := p.Add("freq", 440)
// use freq as a ugen input
return Out{bus, SinOsc{Freq:freq}.Rate(AR)}.Rate(AR)
```

There is no way to use go's `reflect` package to get function argument
names at runtime (which I think would be the best way to specify synth
arguments), so I think this is the next best option.

### Examples

#### sine

SuperCollider:

```SuperCollider
SynthDef(\sine, {
    Out.ar(0, SinOsc.ar());
});
```

Go:

```go
NewSynthdef("sine", func(p *Params) UgenNode {
    Out{C(0), SinOsc{}.Rate(AR)}.Rate(AR)
})
```

## Problems

Below are some of the subtle differences encountered when 
translating synthdefs from sclang to golang.

### BinaryOpUgen

#### sclang

There are subtle differences between the following two
synthdefs:

```supercollider
SynthDef(\foo, {
    Out.ar(0, SinOsc.ar() * Blip.ar());
});
```

and

```supercollider
SynthDef(\bar, {
    Out.ar(0, SinOsc.ar(mul: Blip.ar()));
});
```

The difference is not in how they sound (they should sound identical),
but in how sclang treats them when it sorts the ugen graph.

The ugens in `foo` will be sorted in this order: `SinOsc, Blip, BinaryOpUGen, Out`,
whereas the ugens in `bar` will be sorted in this order: `Blip, SinOsc, BinaryOpUGen, Out`.

BinaryOpUgen is a ugen that most supercollider users should not care about.
Any time you use an arithmetic operator such as `+` or `*` with at least one ugen,
a BinaryOpUGen will be created.

In both `foo` and `bar` the inputs to BinaryOpUGen are (in the order in which they appear
in the synthdef file) SinOsc and Blip.

But as you can see, when we multiply by passing Blip as an argument to SinOsc (`bar`),
Blip will appear first in the topologically sorted ugen list. This is because
sclang treats the Blip ugen _as an input_ to SinOsc (and hence it should be deeper
than SinOsc), when in fact they both become inputs to BinaryOpUGen and are at the
same depth in the ugen tree.

It is tempting to say that the `foo` synthdef is equivalent to

```supercollider
SynthDef(\baz, {
    Out.ar(0, Blip.ar(mul: SinOsc.ar()));
});
```

because sclang treats the second operand of the `*` operator as the
receiver and the first operand as an input. The ugens for the `baz` synthdef
are sorted into the same order as the `foo` synthdef: `SinOsc, Blip, BinaryOpUGen, Out`.

There is a very subtle difference between the two though. You have to inspect the
synthdef file and look at the order of the inputs to BinaryOpUGen. The BinaryOpUGen in the
`foo` synthdef effectively looks like `BinaryOpUGen.ar(SinOsc.ar(), Blip.ar())`
but the one from the `baz` synthdef looks like `BinaryOpUGen.ar(Blip.ar(), SinOsc.ar())`.

The inputs are switched!

Why would this be the case?

#### golang

In sc there is only one way to multiply two ugens: with the `Mul` method.

This will sort SinOsc before Blip:

```go
NewSynthdef("bar", func(p *Params) UgenNode {
    blip := Blip{}.Rate(AR)
    bus, sig := C(0), SinOsc{}.Rate(AR).Mul(blip)
    return Out{bus, sig}.Rate(AR)
})
```

and this will sort Blip before SinOsc:

```go
NewSynthdef("baz", func(p *Params) UgenNode {
    sine := SinOsc{}.Rate(AR)
    bus, sig := C(0), Blip{}.Rate(AR).Mul(sine)
    return Out{bus, sig}.Rate(AR)
})
```

So the question is, how do we translate the `foo` synthdef?

Unfortunately the answer is that you can't.

The golang "bar" synthdef will have the inputs to BinaryOpUGen in the correct order,
but the order of the SinOsc and Blip ugens in the sorted ugens list will be wrong.

Similarly, the golang "baz" synthdef will have a properly sorted ugens list
but the order of the inputs to BinaryOpUGen will be switched.

Luckily the `+` and `*` operators are commutative, so the order of the inputs
to the resulting BinaryOpUGen does not matter.
