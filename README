What
----
This package provides a way to interface directly with the
supercollider server from go programs.

Why
---
Supercollider has a well-deserved reputation for being difficult
to learn. I believe that the sclang is a big reason for this.
I also believe that golang is quite easy to learn, hence
replacing sclang with golang makes a lot of sense to me.

Install
-------
First, and most importantly, you must have supercollider
installed (go to http://supercollider.github.io/download.html).
Next, you must install go (from https://golang.org/dl).
Then
$ go get github.com/briansorahan/sc

Test
----
$ make test

Usage
-----
Find godocs at http://godoc.org/github.com/briansorahan/sc.
Also, take a look at some of the example programs in the
examples/ directory.

Develop
-------
See https://github.com/briansorahan/sc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING

Roadmap
--------
I intend to support
1. Starting, stopping, and monitoring the status of scsynth
2. Defining new synthdefs in go and sending them to scsynth
3. A patterns API similar to what sclang exposes
4. A way to play back patterns using a metronome
5. MIDI input/output
6. OSC input/output

Thanks

This project is hugely indebted to
(1) The supercollider developer community, and
(2) Overtone (https://github.com/overtone/overtone)
