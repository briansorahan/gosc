What
----
This package provides a way to interface directly with the
supercollider server from go programs.

Why
---
Supercollider has a well-deserved reputation for being difficult
to learn. I believe that sclang is a big reason for this.
I also believe that golang is quite easy to learn, hence
replacing sclang with golang makes a lot of sense to me.

Who
---
See https://github.com/briansorahan/sc/blob/master/AUTHORS

What this is not
----------------
sc is not intended for livecoding (for more about livecoding see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding). I may decide someday
to support some livecoding-esque features, but for now the
goal is to be able to build desktop music applications
that use supercollider as the audio engine.

Install
-------
First, and most importantly, you must have supercollider
installed (go to http://supercollider.github.io/download.html).

Next, you must install go (from https://golang.org/dl).

Then
$ go get github.com/briansorahan/sc

Test
----
There are a handful of synthdef files that are necessary for
the tests. These synthdef files are created by sclang,
so you have to

$ make test

instead of

$ go test

Usage
-----
Find godocs at http://godoc.org/github.com/briansorahan/sc.
Also, take a look at some of the example programs in the
examples/ directory.

The list of supported ugens is here: https://github.com/briansorahan/sc/blob/master/ugens/README.md
